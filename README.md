Using Node.js, this project introduces OAuth into our web application through GitHub. The included CSS and HTML set up the basics of the web application, while the app.js and package.json files introduce all of the OAuth code, including storing the Client ID and Secret and using passport.js for authentication. The .env file includes the Client ID and Secret, which have been omitted in this project due to security.
